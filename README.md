### Mine College BE Major Project on Cloud Security using honeyword Concept to Create more secure platform to avoid the hacking practices by hacker


# Abstract

### Authentication and Authorization of user is important to get access into any secured system for which username and password is necessary. Disclosure of password files is a serious security Issue, for which Juels and Rivest proposed Honeywords (decoy passwords) to detect attacks against Hash password databases.

### To protect hash password databases from third party, we implement Honeywords which converts a valid password into new hash passwords. New passwords are the combination of existing password called Honeywords, which are nothing but the Fake passwords. In order to sense impersonation the legitimate password is stored with several Honeywords for each user Account. If proper Honeywords are chosen, a cyber-attacker who steals a file of hashed passwords would be confused, whether it is a real password or Honeywords for user Account. Login with Honeywords will trigger an Alarm, which will notify the administrator about a password file Infraction. To identify or detect occurrence of password database infraction honeypot concept is used. So we implement an easy and efficient solution which will protect and detect exposure events of passwords file.

### Keywords: Authentication, Authorization, Infraction, Honeywords, login, honeypot.
